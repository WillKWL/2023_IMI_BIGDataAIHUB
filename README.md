# Motivation
Financial Institutions are used by criminals to “legitimize” money generated from criminal activities, hence banks are expected by society and regulators to act proactively in detecting and stopping criminals from using the financial system to access their money through effective monitoring and reporting to authorities.

# Complication
- Number of clients and transaction volume are large and only expected to grow in the future
- Diminishing returns of adding more headcount
- Criminals are constantly innovating on ways to use financial system to “legitimize” their funds

# Ask from Scotiabank
- Address challenges across 3 stages of Money laundering (i.e. the act of “turning the proceeds of crime into cash or property that looks legitimate and can be used without suspicion”)
- Stage 1: Placement
  - Money laundering starts by placing funds derived from illegal activities into the financial system in the form of cash deposits, cheque, money transfers or any type of transaction where money enters the Bank.
  - Placement can be identified at the frontline by understanding the source of the funds.
  - Task1: Find known high risk people in our customer base using public data

- Stage 2: Layering
  - Second stage is for a criminal to move funds around to hide their illegal origins. It may consist of multiple transactions without clear purpose to move money between products, clients, bank, corporations and geographies.
  - Layering can be detected by understanding transaction purpose and if it is unusual for the customer.
  - Task2A and 2B: Score clients according to their likelihood of being involved in Money Laundering using transactional data

  - will

- Stage 3: Integration
  - The final stage integrates the illicit proceeds, that now appear to be clean funds, into the economy as "normal" personal or business transactions. By this stage is hard to distinguish between legal and illegal money, and the criminals can now use these funds without suspicion.
  - Integration can be detected by knowing the client and monitor for odd and unusual transactions.
  - Task 3: Enhance scoring and visualize networks using connections between clients
